The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium.  A natural analogue is used to simulate the effect on a modelled variable of imposing preindustrial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, even when the model as a whole may be subjected to varying forcings.

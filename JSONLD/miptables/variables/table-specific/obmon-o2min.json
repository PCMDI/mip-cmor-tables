    "variable:comment": "'Mole concentration' means number of moles per unit volume, also called 'molarity', and is used in the construction mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The concentration of any chemical species, whether particulate or dissolved, may vary with depth in the ocean.  A depth profile may go through one or more local minima in concentration. The mole_concentration_of_molecular_oxygen_in_sea_water_at_shallowest_local_minimum_in_vertical_profile is the mole concentration of oxygen at the local minimum in the concentration profile that occurs closest to the sea surface.",

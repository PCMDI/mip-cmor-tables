Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called 'molarity', and is used in the construction 'mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y', where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'.",

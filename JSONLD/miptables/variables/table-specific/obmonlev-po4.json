  "variable:comment": "Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called 'molarity', and is used in the construction 'mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y', where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. 'Dissolved inorganic phosphorus' means the sum of all inorganic phosphorus in solution (including phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, and phosphoric acid).",

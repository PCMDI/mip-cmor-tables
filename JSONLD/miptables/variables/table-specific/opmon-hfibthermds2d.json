  "variable:comment": "In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, 'flux' implies per unit area, called 'flux density' in physics.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  ' Iceberg thermodynamics' refers to the addition or subtraction of mass due to surface and basal fluxes, i.e., due to melting, sublimation and fusion.",

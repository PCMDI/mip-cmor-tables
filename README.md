The repository content has been developed by climate and computer scientists representing the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and earlier phases, including those from climate modeling groups and model intercomparison projects (MIPs) worldwide. A special mention to Dr. Martin Juckes from the UK Centre for Environmental Data Analysis ([CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/)) for leading efforts in the [CMIP6 Data Request](https://cmip6dr.github.io/Data_Request_Home/). The structure of repository content and tools required to maintain it was developed by climate and computer scientists from the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison ([PCMDI](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/)) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ([LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/)) and the [UK MetOffice](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/), with assistance from colleagues at the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project International Project Office ([CMIP-IPO](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-governance/project-office/)), the Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum ([DKRZ](https://www.dkrz.de/en/)) in Germany and the members of the Infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System Modelling ([IS-ENES](https://is.enes.org/)) consortium.

This work is sponsored by the Regional and Global Model Analysis ([RGMA](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/program/regional-global-model-analysis)) program of the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division ([EESSD](https://science.osti.gov/ber/Research/eessd)) in the Office of Biological and Environmental Research ([BER](https://science.osti.gov/ber)) within the Department of Energy's ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov/)) Office of Science ([OS](https://science.osti.gov/)). The work at PCMDI is performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.
